Floof had an egg binding incident, so Dr. Fitzgerald at COEAH suggested cutting out almost all starches and seeds to keep her from laying eggs. This is what we currently do:
8am: ~ 2 tsp pellet + chop mixture (Harrison's Lifetime Fine,  mix of finely chopped veggies that varies seasonally, like broccoli, bell peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes, etc)
11 - 5pm: I set up some sort of foraging activity with Zupreem Fruit Blend pellets + one of [sprouted safflower seeds, sprouted millet, fruit slices, air popcorn]
5pm: 2 tsp pellet + chop mixture

Since April 2020

Sep 20, 2024: Follow up and behavioral appointment at COEAH to address her egg binding. She was able to pass it eventually, and the behavioral aspect was to prevent it from happening again.

Usually around 4 to 8 hours. As long as I'm home and have time, I let her and the other birds out of their cages. Floof usually interacts with me by flying to me when I walk away, She knows interesting things happen when I'm around, so she likes to stay near me, though she doesn't like me much. She likes to hang out on my shoulder or knee if her mate is there. She does not accept any touching from me (though she used to before she bonded with her mate). Sometimes she gets territorial and divebombs me.


1. Hormones. Floof can be very aggressive toward me. We used to have a good relationship a few years ago. Then she bonded to my green cheek and I suspect that woke up some hormones. Her favorite toys are shredding things. It can distract her for a long time but if I let it go too long, she starts to get nesty. 
2. Screaming. If I don't let her have any shredding material, or she's not interested in her foraging, she screams for such a long time that it's threatened my human relationships. It's especially bad when she's in her cage, where it's relatively boring compared to their play areas.
3. Over-excitement biting. She has a tendency to get easily overstimulated, so even while trick training, she might bite me instead of her seed reward. This has hurt our relationship because it's caused me to develop some reflexive fears, such as reflexively pulling my hand away when I ask her to fly to me, leading her to mistrust me more.

Those three things have trapped us in this cycle of frustration. Any attempts to try to rebuild trust (like with trick training) have backfired. I even tried free flight training (with a mentor), hoping that that could serve as bonding that didn't require my hands being in close contact, though that fell through because I got too scared of predators. I've had some success with at least keeping her entertained through foraging, but have struggled with making the foraging tasks both appealing to her and distracting enough to last a while.

I've watched many videos and online classes from BirdTricks, Avian Behavior International, and other sources, so I know the basics. I suspect more foraging is the solution to most of the problems, but I'm really struggling with having entertaining foraging for a small bird, that I can regularly maintain, especially in her cage.
