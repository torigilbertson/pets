HOW TO USE FOOD AS FORAGING TOYS

You don’t have to live in the woods or on a farm for your bird to benefit from foraging au naturale. Your local supermarket and your imagination has everything you need in stock. The following are meals that I offered to my birds over the past two days:

## 1. An acorn squash

I washed, halved and cooked the squash in the microwave for 4 minutes to make it tender. I scooped out and chopped the insides and mixed them with some of Theo’s favorite foods like peas, corn, cooked rice, apples and beets (which has turned everything the color that it is here). I secured the two halves together with bamboo skewers, and served. Including cooking the squash, it took me less than 10 minutes to make this.

## 2. A cored carrot

I washed a large carrot and used the coring end of a peeler to gouge out holes which I stuffed with cauliflower, green beans, corn, and blueberries. I took only a few minutes to prepare.

I pushed an ice pick through the top of the carrot to create a hole for a bamboo skewer so I could attach the carrot to the cage bars.

## 3. A broccoli stalk

You’d be surprised how much stuff you can fit in between each floret of broccoli. I hid an entire meal in this single stalk! It only took as long to prepare as it did to find places to hide the food.

I tied a rawhide strip around the stalk and attached a quick link to a knot at the other end so that I could hang it from the cage top.

## 4. A green (or red or yellow) pepper

I cut the top off the pepper in the same manner I would a pumpkin when making a jack-o-lantern. I pulled out the insides, reserving the seeds. I punched a few holes around sides so that it would be apparent that there was something inside, and filled it with a mixture of blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, corn and the pepper seeds. I put the top back on the pepper before I served it 

## 5. An apple

 Sometimes I do make green peppers for the small birds, but I cut large holes into the sides which they can put their heads into to get to the food. I filled this with chunks of apple, green beans, beets, carrots and rice.

# Using food as a foraging toy for smaller birds

Wet fillings are just fine when served in a container that is easily cleaned or that is made of something else that is perishable. When your bird is done eating, you simply throw away what remains. However, these same fillings are not always appropriate for many of the plastic foraging toys available.

Bacteria from wet foods can easily accumulate in the crevices, corners and movable parts of plastic foraging toys and they are, therefore, best for foods like nuts and dried fruits. Plastic foraging toys are ideal for pellets. It keeps food safely available for your bird all day long and keeps them challenged with the task of retrieving it while you are away during the day.
