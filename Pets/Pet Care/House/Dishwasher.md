Feel free to run it every day, even if it's not full. There are so many dishes generated by the animals that I find it less stressful to let the dishwasher take care of them instead of washing them by hand.

Extra clean "dishes" for the animals are all in the pantry, including the various container lids.
## Instructions
1. Put the pod (located under the kitchen sink) in the door container and close it.
2. Push "On/Off"
3. Push "Half Load"
4. Push "Start"
