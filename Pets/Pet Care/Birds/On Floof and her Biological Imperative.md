Floof had an emergency in 2024 when an egg got stuck in her reproductive tract. After a few weeks of basically being in birdy labor, all the pieces of egg finally came out. This ordeal probably scarred her reproductive tract and makes it even more likely to happen again should she start producing eggs. To reduce the chances of this happening again, I've implemented a few caretaking steps that might seem odd or overkill at first.

### Diet
You may have noticed that Spicy & Floof have different meals than Yahoo's, and this is because they are on a limited calorie diet. They still get some treats, but they have to forage for it. I've set up foraging in their cage that should last them for about a week, and they sometimes choose to forage instead of eating all their veggies, and that's fine.

This is also why I weigh their chop and give it a sprinkle of shredded paper -- to make them work a little bit to find their favorite bits.

### Lighting
The lights in the bird room are on a timer from 7:30am to 7:30pm. However, the natural daylight in summer can extend their waking hours longer than I'd like. Longer daylight can signal to their bird brains that it's baby-making time. So that's why I include opening/closing the curtains. I want them open during the day so the birds can look outside, but closed at night so that they don't wake up early.

### Cavern Seeking
In the [[Out of Cage Time]] section, I talk about intervening should Spicy & Floof get into a drawer or fixate on the crack under the door. This is because their brains are wired to find cavernous spots to build a nest. A little bit of investigation of cavernous spaces is fine, but once they start trying to dig or chew, it's time to intervene. 

Yahoo also seeks out caverns and gets very interested in the cracks below the doors, but he's not at risk of laying eggs so I only stop him if he's being destructive. There's even a postage tube that he sometimes likes to crawl inside and make funny sounds, and that's ok.
