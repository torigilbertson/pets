## Overstimulation
Like many animals, both high excitement and high fear can look the same in birds, and both excitement and fear can result in some nasty bites.

Here is Yahoo getting a little too excited by the offered bath:

Here is Floof getting too excited for her nest:

Signs of Overstimulation
- Eye pinning (pupils quickly grow and shrink)
- Fanned tail
- Slow movement with head down and wings out ("the cobra")
- Fast bouncing or dancing (dancing to a normal "beat" is fine)
- Fluffed head lowered while "talking" -- Spicy does this the most
- Fluffed head while squawking -- Floof does this usually while replacing food bowls. She looks mad but for her it's just an exciting game


If Yahoo does any of these behaviors with you, he's probably very excited to see you. BUT DO NOT OFFER HIM YOUR HAND. If he's sitting close to exposed skin and starts showing signs of overstimulation, put a blanket between you and him. It usually only takes him a few seconds to calm down.

If you're not sure whether he's over excited, be on the safe side and pick him up with the protected perch. If you want to try it with your hand, do a test by slowly reaching for his beak. If he lets you pet his beak (birds enjoy this), then he's fine to pick up barehanded. But if he lunges or makes any sounds, let him have his space.

I generally don't recommend offering Spicy or Floof your hand unless you've got a treat for them. They don't really care for pets or physical affection in the same way Yahoo does. 

## Bites
I'm hoping it doesn't happen to you, but the truth is that bites are just part of carrying

## Screaming
Spicy and Yahoo both scream/sing during dusk/dawn (or what they perceive as dusk/dawn). And sometimes they get into a fit of screamies that lasts for a few minutes. They're both pretty tolerable.

Floof is different. She screams to convey she is having some big uncomfortable emotions that she doesn't know how to manage, including:

### Fear
(there's an object nearby that she doesn't understand, or she saw signs of a predator outside)

What to do: Remove the object if you can identify what it is. If it was a predator, she stops once she calms down. Sometimes it can help to turn off the lights for a few minutes to signal to her brain that the danger has passed.

### Anger
(this is unfortunately likely to be why she screams while I'm gone)

What to do: Put on headphones and ignore her as best you can. I'm pretty sure she's figured out that she gets less attention when headphones are on, so sometimes that's enough for her to stop screaming. But sometimes not.

### Bored
Offer her something to do, my go-to is to offer her a blanket or my bird shawl to play attack. Watch your fingers though.

You can also offer some toys, like any of the woven wicker items.

### Needs Attention
This happens when Spicy is neglecting his duties as a loving partner. Sometimes the best bet is to get Spicy to stop whatever he's doing and pay attention to her.

### Yelling at Spicy
Spicy can be a little asshole and nip at Floof, especially when he's being playful.
