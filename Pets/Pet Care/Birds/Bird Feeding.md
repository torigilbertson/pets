## Breakfast/Dinner
Chop (the mix of veggies & pellets) is located in the fridge.

Once the provided chop runs low, take the next prepared container from the kitchen freezer and let it thaw in the fridge. It will need some mixing up once it's thawed.

Dump the previous meals into the compost bin (metal bin on the counter ) and put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher.
### Spicy & Floof
6 tupperware lids (extra lids are located in the pantry with all the other containers)
6-8g chop per lid (the mix of veggies & pellets in the fridge)
1 pinch of shredded paper

Shredded paper is located in a little labeled cardboard box on the floor of the pantry.

### Yahoo
Yahoo uses yogurt containers. I will prepare his food in advance and leave it in the fridge. 

In case that food goes bad, here's the recipe:
- 8g chop
- 8g grains

### Water
Fresh filtered water for dinner (water filter is next to sink, Spicy broke the bottom spout so position that over the sink in case of leakage)

Spicy and Floof use the plastic bowls, Yahoo uses the metal bowl. Put previous days bowls in the dishwasher.

## Mixing Chop
There should be enough chop provided, but in case in runs out or goes bad, here's how to mix more
1. 1 Container frozen veggies (in the garage freezer, second shelf from the bottom, it should look colorful and not the one with rice and grains)
2. 15g course Harrison's pellets
3. 15g fine Harrison's pellets
