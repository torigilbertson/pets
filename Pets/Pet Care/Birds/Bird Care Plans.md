## Feelings

## Thoughts
- Worried that Floof will get hormonal because of the unreliable length of day
- Worried that Floof will get hormonal because of the unlimited access to food if I stuff her cage with foraging.
- Worried that taking care of them will require too much time for the caretaker 
- Worried I won't be able to find someone to take care of them for the Aspen trip 
- Worried they will scream all day if they can't get out of their cages
- Worried that they won't understand or adapt to a single feeding
- Worried Yahoo might be hard to read for someone unfamiliar 
- Worried that keeping their food and water inside the cage will be too complicated for the caretaker
## Goals
* To get birds basic needs met while I'm gone
* To keep birds safe from harm
* To provide birds with enrichment while we're gone
* To keep Floof's hormones low

## Ideas 
- Put up popsicle sticks every day
- offer bath for Spicy and Floof?
### Feeding & Watering
~~Option A: Teach birds to station while caretaker replaces water and food~~
Option B: Put outside access feeders on the cage (both food and water)

Do they have to be fed twice a day?
Could they get fresh food in the morning and foraging in the evening? (To simplify things)

### Foraging
#### Shelves (Honeycomb, egg carton, pods, etc)
Make multiple fresh honeycomb shelves
Sprinkle a pinch of fruity pebbles over each toy (by dropping them from the top)

#### Vegetable kababs
Put in cage on the morning I leave, should be safe to nibble for the rest of the time 

### Out of Cage Time?
- If they can be out in the bird room for an hour per day
- Teach how to get birds back inside (step up perch, papaya, almond )
- They need to be supervised so that Yahoo doesn't fight Spicy 
- share Yahoo's danger dance video


### Who can do it?
James
* Lives 20 minutes away, so fewer trips is ideal
* Can make CA trip but not Aspen trip
Gab?
Shara?
Rover?
Ask Facebook?

Boarding
- Floof came back with the screamies and she lost weight last time
- They'll have their basic needs met, but not much more than that

Sonia
- might be fun for her, they can have some time alone
- not sure how the birds and their screaming might affect the baby
