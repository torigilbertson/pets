*~1 hour per day*

## You'll Need
* Hearing protection, they can get loud. There is a spare contruction headset that I'll leave on the futon, in case you need it.
* Shoes/Crocs. It's messy in there, and Spicy has a thing about bare toes.

## Precautions 
 - BE VERY CAREFUL AND SLOW WHILE OPENING AND CLOSING ANY DOORS. They are fast flyers and can quickly fly through doors. 
 - Supervise them if Baloo is present. The birds don’t understand their own frailty and like to harass the cat.
 - Be very careful where you step, they might be on the floor.
 - Wear the bird shawl (gray shawl with a big W on the back) if concerned about them landing on your shoulders. Useful for protecting clothing and getting them off (by removing the shawl)
- Don't touch the curtains if Floof is out, she will try to maul you.
- Floof is sometimes scared of new things, and she tries to attack the scary thing but often misses and bites humans instead. So just be slow picking things up when she's out, and check that she's not going to dive bomb. (The broom is the classic example of this, though she has gotten much better around it with exposure, she might revert while I'm gone.)
- If Spicy and Floof land on you, I advise trying to coax them off by either doing a little hop or by pushing them next to a branch to coax them off. Most of the time they just want to hang out, but they can get nippy around ears and I don't want to risk you getting bitten if I can help it.

## Yahoo's Foraging Bowl
When it's time to go back in the cage, dump the previous day's contents in the big tan tray in the bird room. That is usually enough to motivate him to go to bed.

If the bowl is dirty, replace with a clean one (located below Yahoo's cage) and run the dirty one through the dishwasher.

## Water Fountain
Demonstration:
![[Bird Water Fountain Set Up]]

Set it up on the tall chair in the bird room, with a towel under it. Unplug it when you put the birds to bed.

## Normal Things They Do While Out

### Yahoo
- he'll climb to the floor and tap your foot if he wants attention
- he's pretty safe to pet on the head and neck. He especially loves gentle rubs on the orange feathers behind his head and the shoulder feathers.
- open and close his cage door
- the corner behind the door (there will probably be stuff there waiting for him to move around)
- stare out the window on the tree branch
- bouncing up and down to music (he likes Freebird). Sometimes this gets him really excited so don't try to handle him while he's dancing.
- He will imitate tapping, sniffling sounds, laughing, and engage in quiet "conversation" sounds if you talk to him
- He likes to wrestle but I wouldn't recommend it until you know his body language
- "Surfing", a natural behavior of his species where he vigorously rubs his face on paper towels, blankets, shoes, etc. It's like a little dry bath routine.

### Floof
- Foraging trays
- Tossing things to the floor
- Chewing up the stuff in the white shelves (if she gets into one, pull it out a bit so that it's not an enticing cavern. She can chew but not nest.)
- She likes it if you look at her and tell her she's pretty (no joke, I'm not sure how she knows)
- Traveling up and down the curtains (sometimes she falls but she'll be fine)
- Stare at you while screaming
- Combo of digging+shredding+sitting on cardboard, wood, cork, etc
- Stealing Yahoo's food out of his cage (fine as along as you didn't just deliver a fresh meal to his cage)
- Floof's tricks: "spin", "bow"

### Spicy
- Sitting above the bird bath
- Watching Floof while she gets up to her shenanigans
- Engaging in "conversations" where you imitate what he says
- Tossing a prescription bottle. He'll play this with people just be careful of your fingers.
- Foraging in the trays, specifically for red pellets
- If you say "hi spicy" and raise your forefinger in a little wave, he might wave back
- Other tricks he might do: "knock knock" if you tap your finger twice near him, "fetch" with the colorful paper "bagels"
- Stealing Yahoo's food out of his cage (fine as along as you didn't just deliver a fresh meal to his cage)

| chewing on wires (e.g. the nanny cam wires)                                                                | Pick up the criminal with the hand perch and place them somewhere else. They’ll likely forget about the cable.                                 |
| Floof spending more than a minute investigating the blankets on the couch (she’s trying to dig out a nest) | Carefully remove the blanket (she might get defensive) and distract with wood blocks                                                           |

## Putting Birds Back
### Floof & Spicy
Floof will actually station (put herself in the cage and stand on a specific perch) when she sees you open the papaya container. However, Spicy is not so motivated. 

Floof & Spicy will fly to the perch with a hand-guard, just be careful because Floof is fast and angry.

Once Floof & Spicy are in their cages, give them a dried papaya (pink cubes in the container below their cage).

## Yahoo
If you fill up his foraging bowl when it's time to go inside, he'll usually want to go grab a snack out of it on his own. He might need help seeing the fresh treats, so you can pick him up and let him see it, usually he'll step off your finger and into the cage as long as a perch is close enough.

Foraging bowl method: ![[Yahoo Foraging Bowl]]
If Yahoo is being stubborn, show him an almond and offer the perch. He’ll step right up, and then once you put him in his cage you can give him the almond.

That works 90% of the time, but in the rare occasion where he is absolutely refuses to move and he growls at you. Walk out of the room for a few minutes (while listening for angry bird sounds that mean he might be climbing onto Spicy's cage). Yahoo will get lonely and make some sad solitary beeeeps. That's a sign he's ready to listen.
