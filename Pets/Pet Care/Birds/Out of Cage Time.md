- Separate Yahoo and Spicy if they get too close.
- to get Floof & Spicy back in: using perch, at the very least get Spicy on it and in the cage. Floof will probably get on the perch but will also put herself in the cage once she sees that papaya treats are coming 
- Floof: papaya treats 
- Spicy: dab of mayo
- Yahoo: almond, smashed 
- Run water fountain (refresh water if it's dirty or low )

## Precautions 
- BE VERY CAREFUL AND SLOW WHILE OPENING AND CLOSING ANY DOORS WHILE BIRDS ARE OUT
- wear bird shawl if concerned about them landing on your shoulders. Useful for protecting clothing and getting them off (by removing the shawl)
- Wear socks / Crocs, Spicy attacks bare toes. Shoes are ok just be very careful about where you step because Spicy & Yahoo are often on the ground.
- Don't touch the curtains if Floof is out, she will try to maul you.
- Floof is sometimes scared of new things, and she tries to attack the scary thing but often misses and bites humans instead. So just be slow picking things up when she's out, and check that she's not going to dive bomb. (The broom is the classic example of this, though she has gotten much better around it with exposure, she might revert while I'm gone.)
- If Spicy and Floof land on you, I advise trying to coax them off by either doing a little hop or by pushing them next to a branch to coax them off. Most of the time they just want to hang out, but they can get nippy around ears and I don't want to risk you getting bitten if I can help it.

### Normal Things They Do While Out
Yahoo
- he'll climb to the floor and tap your foot if he wants attention
- he's pretty safe to pet on the head and neck. He especially loves gentle rubs on the orange feathers behind his head and the shoulder feathers.
- open and close his cage door
- the corner behind the door (there will probably be stuff there waiting for him to move around)
- stare out the window on the tree branch
- bouncing up and down to music (he likes Freebird). Sometimes this gets him really excited so don't try to handle him while he's dancing.
- He will imitate tapping, sniffling sounds, laughing, and engage in quiet "conversation" sounds if you talk to him
- He likes to wrestle but I wouldn't recommend it until you know his body language
- "Surfing", a natural behavior of his species where he vigorously rubs his face on paper towels, blankets, shoes, etc. It's like a little dry bath routine.

Floof
- Foraging trays
- Tossing things to the floor
- Chewing up the stuff in the white shelves (if she gets into one, pull it out a bit so that it's not an enticing cavern. She can chew but not nest.)
- She likes it if you look at her and tell her she's pretty (no joke, I'm not sure how she knows)
- Traveling up and down the curtains (sometimes she falls but she'll be fine)
- Stare at you while screaming
- Combo of digging+shredding+sitting on cardboard, wood, cork, etc
- Stealing Yahoo's food out of his cage (fine as along as you didn't just deliver a fresh meal to his cage)
- Floof's tricks: "spin", "bow"

Spicy
- Sitting above the bird bath
- Watching Floof while she gets up to her shenanigans
- Engaging in "conversations" where you imitate what he says
- Tossing a prescription bottle. He'll play this with people just be careful of your fingers.
- Foraging in the trays, specifically for red pellets
- If you say "hi spicy" and raise your forefinger in a little wave, he might wave back
- Other tricks he might do: "knock knock" if you tap your finger twice near him, "fetch" with the colorful paper "bagels"
- Stealing Yahoo's food out of his cage (fine as along as you didn't just deliver a fresh meal to his cage)

## Bird Crimes 
- chewing baseboards, door, or door frame
- digging in trash bin
- trying to get into hall closet
- Yahoo trying to attack Spicy 
- chewing on wires (e.g. the nanny cam wires)
