First, call me. 

If a vet visit is necessary, I will compensate for any time spent taking them there. Colorado Exotic Animal Hospital (COEAH) should have my credit card on file, so use that first. If that doesn't work or you can't get my cc number by calling, I will compensate you for any money spent immediately.

## Emergency Contacts

### Cats
There are fabric cat carriers in the laundry room. If a cat gets sick you’ll have to load them into one of those and drive them to the vet.


**Normal vet:**
Arapahoe Animal Hospital
5585 Arapahoe Avenue, Boulder, CO 80303
303-442-7033

**Emergency vet:**
Colorado Animal Specialty & Emergency
2972 Iris Ave, Boulder, CO 80301

### Birds
The bird carriers are located in the walk-in closet next to the bird room. There’s two canvas carriers, which I use for Spicy and Floof, and 1 metal carrier, which I use for Yahoo. Give them treats to go inside and buckle the carrier in the car seat.
