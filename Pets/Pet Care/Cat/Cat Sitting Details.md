## Food
1/2 can in the morning, 1/2 at night, store opened cans in fridge 
Top off dry food

I use yogurt lids because Baloo pushes his food around. Scape off old food and put the lid in the dishwasher, and put the next canned food meal on a fresh lid. Extra lids can be found in the pantry.

Wash out empty cans and put them in the recycling (any of the 3 smaller bins below the counter).

Canned food is on the bottom shelf in the pantry
Dry food is in white container on floor of pantry 

## Attention 
Baloo will probably want to sit on your lap and get pets.
- Put a blanket on your lap first, his nails tend to get sharp and it hurts on a bare lap.
- Baloo is allowed in bird room while supervised, but if he's being predatory then kick him out.

## Litter boxes
1. Downstairs bathroom (he uses this one most of the time)
2. Upstairs make up room, next to bathroom 

You really only need to clean the downstairs litter while I'm gone, unless the upstairs one stinks. Clean it every day/every other day. Small bags are near the cat food in the pantry. Throw it away in the trash bin outside the front door.

## Totally Optional: clean up
If he puked on the couch, you can clean it if you want, but it's not required. He is old and throws up all the time, and I want to keep the couch covered and protected. I will clean up any mess when I return.

 - Enzyme cleaner is in the downstairs bathroom. 
- Trash bags are above the fridge, small bags are near the cat food in the pantry
