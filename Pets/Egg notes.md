2025.02.05 Floof showing signs of plucking her brood patch, separated into different cages. Have already been restricting food. Only sprouted seeds for treats, everything else is pellets and chop. All food is foraged.
2025.02.09 Plucking down to zero after extreme calorie reduction (no seeds except sprouted millet and what they've been able to find in the foraging trays, no grains, only veggies and pellets)
