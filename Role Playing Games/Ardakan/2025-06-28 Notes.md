#Henrietta #WrightIndustries
## The Spread of Wright Industries
- We find that *The Menagerie* is now *Wright or Wong: arcanistry, artifice, moral quandaries*
- Mr. Wright's location is unknown
- Mr. Wong used to be one of his assistants, saved the business, and is now running this franchise
## Re-Familiarization
### Vincent's House 🏠
- Larsa notes where people have died
- Hyrax sets up the makeshift scrying protections (intestines in jars, candles)
- We all change into Vincent's hand hand-me-downs
### Abbas's Henrietta 🐓
- Finds two chickens who look like Henrietta & seemingly respond to the name. One smells slightly more mushroomy, so Abbas picks that one
- The North-African owners refuse to sell, but offer to give us eggs
- Hyrax grabs the other (currently named "Chicken")
- Abbas, Calliope, and Hyrax make a run for it, Vincent intercepts

### Calliope's Calliope 🥽
- Bought from auction by *Reed & Wright Luthiers*, which is located south of the Floating Market
- Calliope uses the Calliope against the teenage employees and the team runs away
