## Conversing with The Damp, continued

Antiquities Building | Floor B4 | North Wing | 9:15pm
* "Damp mitigation teams reassigned to **Librarian Yusef** for **Stacks Excursion Effort**"
* Damp likely growing through negligence than intention
* This building is organized by geography
* We acquire a 3D "map" of the library as The Damp experiences it
	* Different tastes in different places of the map
	* Labeled by minute recreations of the signs The Damp has encountered
	* "Egyptology" identified by 2 bulges
* Deal made: We eliminate Library Yusef for help getting to the Egyptology sections
* Trade made: Hyrax traded her memories of learning agricultural water divining magic for the ability to read
	* Blooming knowledge, alien skills, mushroom stalk growing into sand
	* Teacher from memories now looks like an amorphous psychedelic mushroom person (like looking in the mirror on LSD)
	* Spore of knowledge, will grow into something more

Library Exit
* Vincent, Hyrax make it through, alarm goes off on Abbas
* Hyrax has an intense urge to eat the novel sitting on the guard's chair, eats it and now she vaguely feels like the events of the smutty romance novel were her own experiences
* Vincent, Calli try to convince the guard not to call the Security and that the alarm was a malfunction. Eventually they let us go.
* "Do not bother Maintenance about The Damp"

## Finding Yusef
Main Library Building | 3am
Destination: Staircase C Floor 26
* We enter disguised as contractors prepared to torch the Damp. They rush us through because they don't want the public to ask questions
* Hyrax ate a history book. Gains knowledge of the ancient mountain routes that used to be the only thing on these mountains, goats, shepherds, rock
	* Can now detect a history book on touch
* Hyrax ate a library map
	* vertigo as she feels like the place she is standing within, gains knowledge of 1st floor
