### Good at
 - Surviving in the wilderness
 - Foraging, hunting, stealth
 - (maybe) Animals see her as one of them. (Not necessarily "speaking" with animals, but communicating with animals in the natural ways they communicate with each other)
 - Intuition
 - Some sort of nature/witchy magic (though she is a novice at it)
 - knives, daggers, combat from stealth

### Bad at
 - social cues, rules, expectations ("low charisma")
 - reading (re: can't)
 - emotional regulation
