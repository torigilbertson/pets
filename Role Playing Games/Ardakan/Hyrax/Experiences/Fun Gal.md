Traded my memories for mushroom memories:
* how I got to the city <=> being very small, very very small, but eventually growing into myself
* my birthplace <=> compression, earth, sky, growing large, torn, taste of a specific location's earth, mortar
* Sneezing fits whenever I try to recall these memories, or if fungal memories come up

Traded memories of learning agricultural water divining magic for the ability to read
* Blooming knowledge, alien skills, mushroom stalk growing into sand
* Teacher from memories now looks like an amorphous psychedelic mushroom person (like looking in the mirror on LSD)
* Spore of knowledge, will grow into something more
