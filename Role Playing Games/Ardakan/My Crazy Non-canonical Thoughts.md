don't fuck with souls

What witch vibes did my mentor have
taboo in most cultures but the taboo varies


Arcane is highly formal (bind to fire, turn to kinetic energy in this rock), eventually leads to insanity
Witch magic is aesthetic (kill this newt and put it in a bag of sumac berries, whisper the name of a dead relative to make people sad over there)

Reapers enforce the soul thing (souls of the dead belong to them)

## Witch Tidbits
* witch bottles (bottles with herbs, name of who is being protected/harmed)
* hair
* fat (e.g. from a baby) applied to a staff -> witches broom flight
* herbs
* cardinal directions
* oomancy: divination via shapes that a separated egg white forms when dropped into hot water

## Desert Elemental Cycle
(my own ideas)

### Generative Cycle
Water -> Life -> Sun -> Sand -> Spirit -> Water
X generates Y
### Destructive Cycle
Sun > Spirit > Life > Sand > Water > Sun
X consumes Y

### Aspects
Attributes, not effects.

## Skinchanging
- dogs are easy because building a bond is easy
- wolves are harder, more like a pact
- birds are risky, a skinchanger may soon lose contact to the mundane things of earth and want only to fly
- Cats are cruel and vain beasts and cannot be easily controlled, only forced.
- Elk andÂ deer are prey whose skins can cause a man to become cowardly
