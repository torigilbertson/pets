#TheDamp 
## The Destination: The Great Grand Library 
evening, 1hr to close
Heading for Antiquities Department, Acquisitions and Receiving, looking for where Mihai came from
* Calliope is working on modifying the library badges to allow us to enter rooms we're normally not allowed in

### Antiquities Department: Acquisitions and Receiving
* Vincent breaks in, walks in like he belongs
* Big empty room, many desks used to be in here
* 1 guy sleeping, 1 guy furiously typewriting away
* They workers don't know why, but one day people came in and cleared out everything, including inbound items that had not been added to the system yet.

### The Damp
First discovered in the bathroom
* Mushrooms sprouting from toilet, sink, spreading over every surface
* 2-4ft tall
* bioluminescent, more so after turning lights on
* smell: earthy, old book smell
* Ensouled
* Consumes words on the page
* This one takes about 10 minutes to envelop a page, 20 minutes to be covered

On B4, in the reconstructed cenote pool
* Fungal stalagmites growing up to the dripping ceiling
* Hyrax introduces herself with an inky thumbprint on paper
* Hyrax trades her memories for information on The Damp's origins
* Speaks through repurposing consumed text (visual Bumblebee)

Origins:
* Albioch
* Dalgren Jad
